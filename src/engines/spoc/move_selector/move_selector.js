/*
*   Predictive and static scores should be on the same scale for direct comparison
*   A static score is based only on the present state of the board
*   A predictive score is based on one or more future states weighted by various factors
*   Each should have an absScore value which is signed so better > worse for the player making the move
*
*   Ranking for moves:
*   - Any move is better than no move
*   - Between moves with only static scores, the best static score wins
*   - Between moves with predictive scores, the best predictive score wins
*   - Between a move with only a static score, and a move with a predictive score, the predictive scored move wins
*     This last state should be avoided by statically scoring all moves first, then predictively scoring the best move before all others
