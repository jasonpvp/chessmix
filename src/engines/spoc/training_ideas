score board based on
- pieces on the board
- mobility of pieces
- pieces covered by other pieces
- pieces at risk of being taken
- moves away from kings
- prefer check when it leads to a near-term advantage
- prefer checkmate
- prefer near-term advantage to long-term

Use calculated scores to train neural networks on recognizing each

Cache path calculations
abort paths that result in significant piece loss. Possibly consider more scores depending on resources
Select paths to explore based on neural net score of each next step?
